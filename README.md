# CC_FinalProject_Sai

The goal of this project is to help normal people get a 
better understanding of blind by creating an experience 
of walking in a black environment only with the help of 
sound. The game is about a blind who need to go to the 
hospital. You will act as the GPS App which could help 
blind find the destination. You could control the 
movement of your character by saying “Go”, “Back”, 
“Left” , “Right”and "Stay".
