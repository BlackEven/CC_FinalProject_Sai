# CC_FinalProject_Sai

The goal of this project is to help normal people get a better understanding of blind 
by creating an experience of walking in a black environment only with the help of sound. 
The story is about a person who suddenly become blind and need to go to the hospital. 
You will act as the GPS App which could help blind find the destination. You could 
control the movement of your character by saying “Go”, “Stay”, “Left” and “Right”.
